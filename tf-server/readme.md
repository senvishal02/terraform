# This Terraform script is used to create a Terraform Server with administrative access via IAM.
# a single S3 bucket will create for the Terraform State File.
# 
# You can set up a Terraform plan on this server after it has been formed, 
# and you can also save the Terraform state file to prod folder on the S3 bucket.
